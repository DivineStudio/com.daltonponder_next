Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router project

## Changes Made:

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics package
- Added @vercel/analytics version 1.6.1 to dependencies
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json

### 2. Modified app/[locale]/layout.tsx
- Imported Analytics component from '@vercel/analytics/next'
- Added <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, after the NextIntlClientProvider closing tag
- Positioned according to best practices for App Router projects

### Files Modified:
- app/[locale]/layout.tsx - Added Analytics import and component
- package.json - Added @vercel/analytics to dependencies
- package-lock.json - Updated with new package dependencies

## Implementation Details:

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file at app/[locale]/layout.tsx, which is the main layout for this App Router project. The component is placed inside the body tag, after all the main content and provider components (NextIntlClientProvider, ThemeProvider), following Vercel's recommended placement.

This configuration ensures that Vercel Web Analytics will track page views and user interactions across all pages in the application.

## Verification:

✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ No new linting errors introduced (existing linter warnings in other files are pre-existing)
✓ Dependencies installed and lock files updated correctly

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment to Vercel.
