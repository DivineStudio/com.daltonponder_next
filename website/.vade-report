# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 16.1.6 project with App Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using npm
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` to lock dependency versions

### 2. Code Changes
**Modified: `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after `<Analytics />` component
- Followed the same pattern as the existing Vercel Analytics integration

## Implementation Details
Since this is a Next.js 16.1.6 project using the App Router (Next.js 13.5+), I used:
- Import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (not the React version)
- Direct component placement without needing `usePathname()` hook
- The component is placed in the root layout at `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

The SpeedInsights component will automatically:
- Track page performance metrics
- Send data to Vercel's Speed Insights dashboard
- Work seamlessly with the existing Analytics setup

## Verification
✅ Package installed successfully (no vulnerabilities)
✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linter ran without introducing new errors
✅ All changes staged with git

## Notes
- The implementation follows Next.js App Router best practices
- Placed alongside the existing `@vercel/analytics` component
- No additional configuration needed - works out of the box when deployed to Vercel
- The component is lightweight and won't impact page load performance
